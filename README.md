## Vision

I'm involved with the CiviCRM Establishment Committee to help define and frame the future governance structure for the CiviCRM project so that we can i) increase community involvement in decision-making, ii) ease the burden on the existing Core Team (of 4), iii) continue to work in an open, constructive and positive environment, and iv) grow the CiviCRM community of users and contributers.
