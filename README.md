# OL7-healthy-open-communities
Repo for Open Leaders 7 course with Mozilla: Governance and Community Involvement

See linked Issue:

https://github.com/MozillaFestival/open-leaders-7/issues/53

## Vision

I'm involved with the CiviCRM Establishment Committee to help define and frame the future governance structure for the CiviCRM project so that we can i) increase community involvement in decision-making, ii) ease the burden on the existing Core Team (of 4), iii) continue to work in an open, constructive and positive environment, and iv) grow the CiviCRM community of users and contributers. 

### How will the OL programme help?

The programme will increase my knowledge and understanding of the characterstics for healthy and open communities, and methods for recognising and evaluating the health of the community.
Improving my 'Design/Build/Empower for Understanding' will make it easier for people to get involved and contribute effectively to the CiviCRM project.
